# Outcomes: What's My Brand? Part 1

Your brand is your value proposition. It is important to understand who you are as a professional in your chosen field. It is what makes you uniquely qualified over candidates who are just merely qualified based solely on hard skills. 
This worksheet will prepare you for the branding workshop. After the workshop you'll have the tools and information needed to draft your brand statement. 

Outcomes will not be giving you feedback on this worksheet, but please take it seriously as it will make it easier to craft your brand statement.

Do you have a mentor? If so, what are their attributes?
- Kevin McCabe, my former graduate advisor is the closest thing to a mentor I have. He's incredibly intelligent, and incredibly talented. He has also been able to establish brand new fields of research, and has maintained an astounding level of intellectual curiosity, despite being in his mid 60s. To his detriment though, he is overly political, which may simply be a result of his work environment - which means he's willing to waste whole days bemoaning political correctness, much to my chagrin, as he refused to beleive there was any merit behind the arguments of those he disagreed with, but seemingly only when it came to politics. Along with this, is his inability to set strict deadlines, or commit to project design specifications. Everything we would work on would have constantly shifting expectations. This was something that annoyed me to no end.
